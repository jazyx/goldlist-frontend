# GOLDLIST METHOD FRONTEND #

Vite-powered React frontend for recording and reviewing new words and expressions in a foreign language, to be hosted by an Express backend [Repo](git@github.com:jazyx/goldlist-backend.git) 

[Overview of the paper-and-pen Goldlist method](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/languages/learning-languages/the-goldlist-method)

The app allows you to enter new expressions that you have met in the language you are learning, together with a hint about their meaning. These expressions will be shown to you a few days later, and you will be encouraged to type out those that you are not yet ready to remember, and to select at least 30% of the words to retain in your long-term memory.

3. Twelve pre-defined lists of simple English vocabulary are provided to help understand how the method words

   2. How many words to add to complete each list
   3. How many days will pass before you are asked to review a list
   (The last two preferences are saved across devices.)
6. You can show or hide the hints and typing preview for all expressions, or on an expression-by-expression basis
7. If you choose to hide hints and typing preview, you can press Backspace while typing a review expression to show the full expression and its hint momentarily
8. Optional characters used to indicate word stress are ignored when retyping expressions
